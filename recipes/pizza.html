    <p>Homemade pizza is a simple and satisfying dish made with a soft, chewy dough topped with tomato sauce, melted cheese, and any toppings you love. Making pizza at home gives you full control over thickness, flavor, and ingredients, and it’s surprisingly easy once you get the hang of the dough.</p>
